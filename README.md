## 🎯 Core Components

### Tech Ecosystem
The Tech Ecosystem visualizes my technical skills as interconnected nodes in a 3D space, showing how different technologies relate to each other in my work. Technologies are categorized (frontend, backend, tools) and include interactive tooltips with descriptions.

### Skill Constellations
This cosmic visualization groups my skills into "constellations" representing different domains (frontend, backend, tools). Users can explore the night sky, click on stars to learn about specific technologies, and zoom in for details.

### Code Editor Showcase
A simulated code editor that displays real code examples in various languages and frameworks. Features syntax highlighting, line numbers, and tabbed navigation between different technologies.


## 📱 Responsive Design

The portfolio is designed to work beautifully across all devices:

- **Desktop**: Full 3D experiences with all interactive elements
- **Tablet**: Optimized 3D elements with touch-friendly controls
- **Mobile**: Simplified but still engaging experience with essential content

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Implement blog section for technical articles
- [ ] Add more interactive 3D elements
- [ ] Create downloadable PDF resume option
